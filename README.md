IPythonIsGreat

IPython notebooks for my talk "IPython is Great (for large-scale computation, data exploration, and creating reproducible research artifacts)" which I presented at a Stanford Graphics Laboratory group meeting in May 2013, as well as at the Harvard Visual Computing Group retreat in August 2013.
